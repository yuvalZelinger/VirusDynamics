folder "VirusDynamics1" contains the necessary for Exercise 1.
folder "VirusDynamics2" contains the necessary for Exercise 2.

--Both projects contain simulation of virus dynamics.
-"VirusDynamics1" Without the possibility of using drugs.
-"VirusDynamics2" With the possibility of using drugs.

---To Start the program click on "Run Virus Dynamic 1" in "VirusDynamics1" or "Run Virus Dynamic 2" in "VirusDynamics2"

-When you start, you can enter data On which the program will run(Total number of cells, Number of virus cells ,
Probability of cleaning , Probability of reproduction ,Probability to develop drug immunity)
-to start press start.
-then select the number of stages you want to simullate and click "simullate stages".
-Each step can be performed in more stages".
-A drug can be added at any stage.


**The folders("VirusDynamics1" and "VirusDynamics2") contain a file "Simulation examples" that
 contains examples of running the program simulation on the required data.
